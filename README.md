## Gruvbox Theme for 4coder

Gruvbox is one of my favorite colorschemes to use in any editor and have used it in Neovim, Kakoune, Vis and now, that includes 4coder. Everything is mostly done but updates and tweaks will come in the following week(s). If you have an issue, file one and if you can improve the theme, request me to pull in your changes in.

Based on this Gruvbox provided by the nice people at Vis: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samlwood/vis-gruvbox/master/gruvbox.lua
