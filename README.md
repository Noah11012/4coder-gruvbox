## Gruvbox Theme for 4coder

## Note: This repo is a work in progress.

This repo is getting a much needed update after two years of neglect. Eventually, I will provide a light version of the theme as well after
completing the dark version. A screenshot is provided below so everyone knows how it looks. Hopefully in the coming days I will be able to flesh
out the rest of the theme especially when it comes to the UI.
